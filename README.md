# Adiber-Web
This is my Website since 2019 👴🏻

## Languages
- ReactJS - Frontend 🎨
- ExpressJS - Backend 🧰

## Idea
### Frontend
The frontend does, what it usually does - it renders the Website for the User

### Backend
Why a backend? - you ask. Well, because performance. I don't want to send requests to Github's API every time a user loads the page. And for the YouTube Data API this would not work, because after a bit of time the limit would be reached. Also I don't want the frontend to read files everytime a user visits my website, which is why I use the backend as an hourly updated cache.
