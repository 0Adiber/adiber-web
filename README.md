## About
I started this Website as is back in 2019 👴🏻. Why did I stop? - Well, because I neither had the time nor the motivation. It is not finished yet, but as soon as I am able to continue, I will. I would really enjoy hearing your opinion or suggestions for improvement. 😁

## Languages
- ReactJS - Frontend 🎨
- ExpressJS - Backend 🧰

## Idea
### Frontend
The frontend does, what it usually does - it renders the Website for the User

### Backend
Why a backend? - you ask. Well, because performance. I don't want to send requests to Github's API every time a user loads the page. And for the YouTube Data API this would not work, because after a bit of time the limit would be reached. Also I don't want the frontend to read files everytime a user visits my website, which is why I use the backend as an hourly updated cache.

<br>**Important to note** is, that I started this back then, when I did't have a clue of React (=>explains the unconventional code) - I will refactor it at some point in the next few weeks

## Info
For (frontend-) deployment I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
<br>The (backend-) deployment is possible because of [Microsoft Azure's](https://azure.microsoft.com/de-de/free/students/) free 100$ credit with the [Github Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
<br>I got my totally awesome domain free from [name.com](https://name.com) also because of the [Github Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
