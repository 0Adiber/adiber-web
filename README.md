## About
I started this Website as is back in 2019 👴🏻. A lot has changed in version 2. It is not finished yet, but it soon will be. I would really enjoy hearing your opinion or suggestions for improvement. 😁

## Languages
- ReactJS - Frontend 🎨
- (ExpressJS - Backend 🧰)

## Idea
### Frontend
The frontend does, what it usually does - it renders the Website for the User

### Backend
Does not exist anymore, because I have no credits on Azure left :(
(Why a backend? - you ask. Well, because performance. I don't want to send requests to Github's API every time a user loads the page. And for the YouTube Data API this would not work, because after a bit of time the limit would be reached. Also I don't want the frontend to read files everytime a user visits my website, which is why I use the backend as an hourly updated cache.)

## Info
For (frontend-) deployment I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
<br>I got my totally awesome domain free from [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com) also because of the [Github Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
