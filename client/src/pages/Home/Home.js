                                    , learning a (programming) language or watching some Netflix. Playing computer games is sometimes
                                    also something I do as a matter of pleasure.</p>

                            <h2>What got me interested in IT?</h2>
                            <p>When I was in 3rd grade of secondary school, I learned touch typing, which were the beginnings of my IT career. 
                                But same as all great things, my journey really started with Minecraft. I enjoyed playing various Minigames on different Minecraft Servers, 
                                which led me into creating my own Server, resulting in my first (but not last) experience with Linux (Debian). Soon I understood, that using other people's
                                Plugins is not gonna work out for me, so I started learning how to program Minecraft Plugins (~12 years of age), which is how my (bumpy) Java journey started.

                            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                            <p>Today's World is a fast changing World - So am I ðŸ˜„. Some days I like to read for hours, others I don't. Then I just wanna program, while the next day I can't take a look at any code</p>
                            <h3>Programming</h3>
                            <p>As you probably guessed, I like programming. I find myself especially interested in working with other people's APIs</p>
                            <h3>Cybersecurity</h3>
                            <p>CTFing with <a href="https://github.com/B34nB01z" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="pretty-link">@Beanboiz</a> and <a href="https://hack.more.systems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="pretty-link">@LosFuzzys</a> - whilst always learning something new</p>
                            <h3>Gaming</h3>
                            <p>As your typical IT Guy, I also play some games. At the moment not really a lot of it, but there were times. My most favourite games are CS:GO, Rocket League and the all-time star Minecraft.</p>
